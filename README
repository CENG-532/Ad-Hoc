# How to run

1) Put all .py files, run.sh file and config.ini file to the mininet environment through sftp
    $ sftp mininet@<eth0-inet addr>
2) Connect to mininet via ssh:
    $ ssh -X mininet@<eth0-inet addr>

3) Run the topology:
    $ sudo mn --custom topology.py --topo mytopo --mac --link tc

There are 5 nodes in the topology named:
 -nodeA
 -nodeB
 -nodeC
 -nodeD
 -nodeE

4) Open all the nodes via xterm:
    $ xterm h1
    $ xterm h2
    $ xterm h3
    $ xterm h4
    $ xterm h5

5) Start the node by running run.sh
    $ ./run.sh nodeA
    $ ./run.sh nodeB
    $ ./run.sh nodeC
    $ ./run.sh nodeD
    $ ./run.sh nodeE

6) After starting, node waits for a "command".
    - Writing "auto" will send packets constructed from input_<nodename>.txt
    - Writing "manual" will allow you to send packet from terminal
        * First, write a message
        * Then, write a destination

* config.ini can be modified for different settings or topologies
* In order to close a node, ctrl + c must be pressed 3 times (we could not find any better way because zeromq sockets are not closed upon a regular exit
* Nodes are printing message information on network layer and application layer.
